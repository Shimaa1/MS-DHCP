# MS-DHCP codes
1. The detail codes in the paper "A Novel Multimodal-Sequential Approach based on Multi-view Features for Network Intrusion Detection" is given under the directory "Experiments".
2. It should be noted that the experimental code consists of three parts, which are implemented on three different datasets, and their relationship is parallel. 
3. In each part, there are several folders, such as "LSTM", "MDAE", "ms-dhcp", and so on, which contain all the relevant codes needed to realize the model related to folder name.
4. The datasets used in the experiment can be obtained publicly, so dataset download is not provided
